## Motivation

Here in this work, we aimed to find the interacting regions of KDM6A, TLE1, HES1, RUNX1-2, and HHEX to understand the potential structural arrangement of the biomolecular complexes they involved in. Investigating the literature gave us the advantage to create the initial contact map of the interested proteins (see figure below).

Using this map, we modeled interacting protein pairs in domain-domain or domain-motif level. The details are listed in below:

- **KDM6A-TPR:TLE1-Q** interaction is modeled by using a reference structure, [6EJN](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6EJN), showing the evidence of interaction in between TPR and coiled coils. [FATCAT](https://fatcat.godziklab.org/fatcat/fatcat_pair.html) server is used to obtain superimposed model.  
- **TLE1-Q:HHEX** interaction is modeled by [AlphaFold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) multimer. Sequences of Q domain and the first N-ter 98 are used for TLE1 and HHEX, respectively.


- **TLE1-WDR:HHEX** is originated from WDR:EH1 complex, [2CE8](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2CE8). The sequence of EH1 peptide, MFSIDNILA, is converted to FYIEDIL through modeling TLE1-WDR:HHEX complex by mutating the necessary amino acids. We improved the positions of side chains in the interface after implementing the mutations by [HADDOCK 2.4](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/submit/1).

- **TLE1-WDR:RUNX** complex is originated from WDR:WRPW complex, [2CE9](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2CE9). The original WRPW peptide is mutated into WRPY peptide to form TLE1-WDR:RUNX interaction. Mutation implementation and refinement procedures also carried out by HADDOCK 2.4.

- **TLE1-WDR:HES1** interaction exists in [2CE9](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2CE9) complex. Therefore, we only applied refinement to improve the interface with HADDOCK 2.4.
